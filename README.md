# AmazonRecommendationSystem
This project implements a method for dimensionality reduction and approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces to enhance product recommendations on Amazon's e-commerce platform. Utilizing the Amazon ML Product Browse Node Classification dataset from the Amazon ML Challenge, the project follows the data analysis life cycle, including discovery, data preparation, model planning, building, results communication, and operationalization. The primary focus is on improving recommendation accuracy through Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and cosine similarity calculations. LSH facilitates efficient product recommendations by analyzing textual data, ensuring that products with the same browse node ID as the queried product are excluded from recommendations. The project integrates PySpark and natural language processing modules to handle large datasets effectively, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.7842, which indicates a strong correlation between recommended products and user purchase history. This project demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of PySpark in building a comprehensive product recommendation system.
